		Intellectual property rights (IPRs) have been acknowledged and protected in the People's Republic of China since 1979. The People's Republic of China has acceded to the major international conventions on protection of rights to intellectual property. Domestically, protection of intellectual property law has also been established by government legislation, administrative regulations, and decrees in the areas of trademark, copyright and patent. This has led to the creation of a comprehensive legal framework to protect both local and foreign intellectual property. Despite this, copyright violations are common in the PRC,and intellectual property violations are committed by prominent members of the automotive and electronics industries, And i feel this is okay because they are taking the measures to help protect their people along with the creativity or succes of other and for people who are against it they should not try and take ideas from major companies for the fact that this is what they are protecting and they are strong about this idea
